# Systematic Code Review 2026-07

## Status

- Scope: full frontend framework codebase review for `scone-ui`.
- Mode: docs-only audit; no source behavior changes in review tasks.
- Source of execution order: `TODO.md`.
- Temporary runbook: `docs/30-designs/RUNBOOK-SYSTEMATIC-CODE-REVIEW-2026-07.md`.

## 01 Baseline

### Project Facts

- Framework: React 19 with TypeScript strict mode.
- Build tool: Vite 8 with `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `@tailwindcss/vite`.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4, project CSS in `src/styles.css` and `src/styles/theme.css`.
- Test runner: Vitest 4 with jsdom and `@testing-library/react`.
- Lint: ESLint 10, TypeScript ESLint recommended rules, React Hooks rules, React Refresh export rule.
- Package manager/runtime: pnpm 10, Node `>=22`.
- Public package entry: `src/index.ts`.
- Demo-only runtime entry: `src/main.tsx` -> `src/app.tsx`.

### Boundary Facts

- This repository is a component library and governance workspace, not a product application.
- No router, request layer, backend contract module, global store, or server-state library is present.
- Source code is organized by public component families: `components/form`, `components/data-display`, `components/layout`, `components/feedback-overlay`, `components/navigation`, `components/media`, `patterns`, `lib`, `types`, `styles`.
- `src/components/ui` contains shadcn/Radix primitive wrappers and is excluded from the public package entry.
- Current lint configuration intentionally disables Fast Refresh component-only export warnings for vendored UI files, Form compound/context files, and Pattern compound files.

### Verification Baseline

Configured commands:

- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm build`

Recent evidence before this review branch:

- `pnpm format:check` passed.
- `pnpm test -- src/index.test.ts` ran the full Vitest suite: 69 files, 253 tests passed.
- `pnpm lint` passed.

### Initial Assessment

- The current technology stack is intentionally small for a reusable UI library.
- Absence of routing, network, and global state is aligned with repository scope.
- The highest-risk review areas are public API shape, compound component exports, Pattern state ownership, and consistency between SPEC, DESIGN, readiness, and source.
